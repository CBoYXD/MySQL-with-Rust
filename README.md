This repository will help you, when you will use mysql with Rust\
In this project i will use [mysql crate](https://crates.io/crates/mysql).\
So you must write in ``Cargo.toml`` this dependencies: ``mysql = "24.0.0"``, ``dotenv = "0.15.0"``\
The last dependency is needed in order to get mysql url from ``.env`` file.\
An example of how the ``.env`` file should be written is in ``example.env``\
**Good luck** 😁
